# Custom Presence
### a small RPC presence program designed for customizability
---

Custom Presence is a python program that utilizes the Discord RPC to make a custom status.
It relies on `pypresence` as well as `psutil`. It also requires `colorama` for Windows color support.

You can use `config.py` to setup custom programs, change refresh times, etc.


For a small example of adding a custom program to it, run `python main.py --setup` for instructions.
